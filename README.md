# Peek Baccarat Calculator
An optimal strategy calculator for Evolution's Peek Baccarat based on 20,000 simulations. There is no official strategy released as of now for this game and if there was it would be very complicated hence I decided to make my own calculator. The banker should be slightly RTP than the player, hence it would be optimal to bet on the banker. Combined with this calculator, you will play very close to the published RTP of 98.80%.

For each round:
- Enter if are betting on the Player (P) or Banker (B).
- Enter the values of any revealed Player cards (1st card & 2nd card).
- Enter the values of any revealed Banker cards (3rd card & 4th card).
- Once you have completed the fields, then click the 'Calculate' button.
- Once the 20,000 simulations have run (should be very quick), a message will appear telling you the optimal strategy and the EV for each action. It will never be optimal to double your bet so this action is never displayed.

Reminder:
- For a near 50-50 scenario, the incorrect strategy may be displayed. However, since the EVs are displayed you will able to see how close it really is. But for these rounds the way you play doesn't make a difference as it is basically a 50-50.

You can toggle the 'TopMost' checkbox if you want the program to overlap all the other programs. This can be useful when playing, so the program doesn't disappear when you are actually playing your hand and you won't have to reopen it from the taskbar.
